## Description

This project implements a simple Python script for a random word guessing game. The script generates a random word from a predefined list and prompts the user to guess a letter. It incorporates input validation to ensure that only single alphabetical letters are accepted. The aim of the project is to practice working with lists, random module, user input, and basic conditional statements in Python.

### What I Learned

- Working with lists in Python
- Utilizing the random module for random selections
- Handling user input and implementing input validation
- Writing basic conditional statements
